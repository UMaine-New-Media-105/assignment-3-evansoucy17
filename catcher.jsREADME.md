Question 1

For assignment 3.1 I created a code that was able tyo design a small frog cather for the game we are making. 
I first made my frog on a larger scale so it would be easy to design then I minimized it to .14 of its orignial  
size so it could fit within the 50 x 50 parameters. Then I created a sky and ground for the backgorund of the game 
and when placing the catcher in the game changed the position of x to mouseX so it will follow the mouse but keeping 
the Y-axis the same so it will sit on the ground and not move vertically. 


Question 2

For assignment 3.2 I changed the code so that when the mouse is pressed the arms of my sprite raise and the eyes turn red. The only issue I ran into slight difficulty was getting all of the syntax correct to make sure my function worked properly.
